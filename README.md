**BACKGROUND**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the past few months, I have been taking classes in data analytics and visualization,
and after learning how to use Python, Pandas, and MatPlotLib, I decided to create a 
dataset to practice and apply what I learned: a running table of my favorite albums 
and records of all time.

**DATASET**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset, in .csv format, consists of 200+ albums, with each entry consisting of 
the album's title, artist, release year, genre, the releasing record label, and the 
artist's country of origin.

**ANALYSES**
