**BACKGROUND**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the past few months, I have been taking classes in data analytics and visualization, and after learning how to use Python, Pandas, and MatPlotLib, I decided to create and analyze a dataset of my favorite albums of all time, which I have kept a running tally of for the past 8 or so years.

During my adolescence, I became much more interested in exploring popular music after picking up an issue of Q magazine with the cover story of the greatest albums ever as voted by their readers. Such lists from that magazine and other outlets, as well as year-end best-of lists from Q and other publishers, have helped guide my musical explorations, in addition to other discoveries I've made on my own. 

With this dataset, I wanted to get a profile of my musical tastes, exploring which years, genres, and countries are predominantly represented in my list, and conversely those which are underrepresented. The resulting analyses can not only provide a profile of my musical tastes, but also identify opportunities to further diversify and round out my musical explorations.

**DATASET**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset consists of 200+ albums, with each entry consisting of the album's title, artist, release year, genre, length (in minutes), the releasing record label, and the artist's country of origin. 

The albums were originally listed in my personal iTunes library, and album metadata was applied automatically by iTunes from Gracenote's database. Wikipedia was referenced to verify each album's release year, genre, length, record label, artist's country of origin, and whether or not it is a compilation album. All of this information was manually entered into Microsoft Excel, and the spreadsheet was saved in CSV format.
